			<h3>What are the delivery charges?</h3>
			Delivery charge varies with each Seller.<br> Sellers incur
			relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases,
			charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs.
			The delivery charge may be waived off by some Sellers, if you shop
			with them for a minimum predefined value.<br> For example,
			seller WS Retail charges Rs 40 for delivery per item if the order
			value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are
			delivered free. Please check with individual Sellers to understand
			their delivery charges.<br>

			<h3>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery
				timeline of X-Y business days?</h3>
			<p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a
				holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of
				delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page.
				In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier
				partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in
				to the delivery dates.</p>
